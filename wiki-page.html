                        </h2>
                        <p class="hero-description">Abrams is a close range tank character that excels in using his shotgun and melee’s to deal high burst damage while having consistent sustainability. His abilities help him sustain himself through lifesteal and regeneration effects, as well as apply stun effects to make it easier for Abrams to land heavy melee hits for maximum damage. He excels highly in the close range, and if supplied with the proper items, can become an unkillable monster in team fights and 1v1 situations. His ability to deal high burst damage through melee attacks comes with a downside; the parry mechanic in the game. If Abrams gets parried, there is a very high chance that the opposition will target you, causing you to take massive damage, and possibly causing you to limp out of a team fight, or worse, dead.</p>

From stolen art, to missing persons, to ritual murders; Abrams didn't just take any case that came across his desk... he solved them.</p>
                            <p style = "margin-bottom: 23px">But his days of following cheating spouses came to an end the day he opened his office door and found The Tome sitting on his desk.</p>
                            <p style = "margin-bottom: 23px">No instruction was left for him save for a brief note scrawled in onyx blood that read "Don't let them have it". Abrams hasn't figured where the thing came from; but seeing as his home has been broken into, his office tossed on 3 different occasions, and his car firebombed he has a vested interest in figuring out what the hell is going on.</p>
